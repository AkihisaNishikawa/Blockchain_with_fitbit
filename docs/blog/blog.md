# Blog: MY-PROJECT-TITLE

**MY-NAME**

## My First Blog Entry

This is my first blog entry.

The blog is written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).  Markdown is a simple text-based mark-up language.

## My Second Blog Entry

This week, I learned how to include
[images](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images)
in my blog.

![cat](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/sblott/2017-ca400-YOUR_NAME/raw/master/docs/blog/images/cat.jpg)

Here are the instructions:

- Add the image to your repo (probably using the +images+ sub-directory here).
  The cat example above is in `./images/cat.jpg`.

- Commit that and push it to your repo.

- On Gitlab, navigate to your new image and click *Raw*.  You get the raw URL of your image.  Copy that URL.

- Add your image to this document using the following format:

    ![alternative text](URL)

See the example [here](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/sblott/2017-ca400-YOUR_NAME/raw/master/docs/blog/blog.md).
