Instructions:

1. Upload your video walk through to Google Drive.
2. Under sharing, allow anyone with the link to view the video.
3. Place a link to the video above, and uncomment those lines (see [here](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/sblott/2017-ca400-YOUR_NAME/edit/master/docs/video-walk-through/README.md)).
4. `git commit -a`, `git push`.
5. Using incognito mode on your browser, verify that the video is indeed accessible to anybody with the link.

Remember that your video may not be more than 5 minutes long - if it is, you can assume that the examiners will not review any more than the first 5 minutes of your video unless you have agreed in advance that you require more than 5 minutes for your video.
