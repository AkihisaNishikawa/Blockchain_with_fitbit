# MCM PRACTICUM

This is a template for MCM practicums.  Please read these instructions carefully.

This file is written in
[markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  Markdown
is a suitable format for documents stored in git repositories.

## Instructions

You *must* do the following:

1 - Fork this repo.

2 - There is no need to rename your fork but if you wish to do so please use 
     settings (https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/username/2019-mcm-XXXX/edit)
     Advanced (Expand This) 
     Then change the "Rename repository" field with

     2018-mcm-username

replacing `username` with your School of Computing login name.

For example, if Stephen Blott were to be doing a fourth-year project, he would rename
his repo as:

 2018-mcm-sblott


You should also update the *Project description*.

3 - This directory has two sub-directories.

- All of your source code should be placed in the `src` sub-directory.

- All of your documentation should be placed in the `docs` sub-directory.

- Your project blog should be placed in the `blog` sub-directory. 


4 - There is further important documentation in the `docs` directory.  Read that next.

When you are have followed all of these instructions and are sure that you
understand what is expected, you may replace the contents of this file with a
brief description of your project (two or three paragraphs).
